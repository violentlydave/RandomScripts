Lots of random scripts written for random reasons,
maybe helpful to others, maybe not.

eatdupreport.sh - When Arcsight ESM upgrades fail w/ duplicate DB entries, this will take the report it outputs and show you the SQL commands to run to fix it.

summarize_burphtml.sh -- Feed this a Burp report in HTML, and it'll (ugly/quickly) summarize it into a single page.  Useful for report writing/summarizing.
